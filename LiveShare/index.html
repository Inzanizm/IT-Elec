                Extension AdvocacynConferencer Champions of Change (IMREACH)<br>

            </h3>

            <p>The University of Rizal System deems it essential to sustain its efforts on the internationalization of
                operations.
                The twin functions of research and extension are very significant and therefore keeping abreast on the
                new developments will be of great help to the academic community. The continued dissemination of
                significant information will therefore ensure that academic, research and training institutions are
                making
                scholarly outputs and community development outcomes accessible to stakeholders.
                The 2025 URS International Multidisciplinary Research and Extension Advocacy Conference
                for Champions of Change (IMREACH) intends to serve as an avenue for researchers and extension
                practitioners across disciplines to share relevant information, research outputs and best practices
                in community development. This will benefit the interested groups with enhanced understanding
                and appreciation of research development and extension services not only as institutional mandates but
                as
                commitment to help improve life. The international multidisciplinary research and extension advocacy
                conference for champions of change will give opportunity to widen prospects, strengthen partnerships and
                gain knowledge on innovative and scaled up initiatives for more empowered communities.
